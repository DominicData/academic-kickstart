I'm a systems development engineer at Amazon Web Servcies. I have a wide range of knowledge in the cloud space having worked on a number of different projects and passed the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam.

My main programming languages are Python and Go though I know some C++. I have deployed modern cloud services like Grafana, Prometheus and sonarQube.

My other interests outside of work include Machine Learning, High Performance Computing and Optimization. Check out some of my work!
